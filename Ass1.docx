 Assignment 1-

1-
 *    is operator (expression)
‘hello’ is  value 
-87.8   is value
-   expression
/ expression
+ expression
6  expression

2-string and variable

Strinng are the data . And variable are symbols where we are storing our data .

3- Describe three different data types.

Integer-  Integer , it contains  +ve and -ve numbers . We can’t store decimal numbers in integers.

Float- It contains +ve and -ve numbers with decimal points.

String – It contains the group of characters . We have to store the string like this
          
          james= “James”



4- Python expression 
 Python expression are made of operators ,literals and identifiers . This is the way how we are representing our value in different formats.

Like – 4 can be expressed as

Because eggs is valid identifier and 100 is valid integer , it can be valid identifier but it will create problem ,that’s why it is invalid.


9- What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?


Integer-int() 
Float- float()
String- str()

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
"I have eaten " + 99 + " burritos"

Because 99 is number , it can not be combined with string. So we will convert this number to string using str()

"I have eaten " + str(99) + " burritos"
